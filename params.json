This will stop executing the succeeding functions in the list and will call the default error handler(if defined) for the function.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\nThe above example is complete enough to understand how the directive would work. However feel free to copy paste only the directive code and add in your app if you don't want to inject dependncy on your main module.\r\n\r\n### Note \r\n\r\nYou might be wandering what if we call the **same functions** that are in the `list` individually, instead of the directive via `ng-click` (for example `ng-click=\"validate()\"`) on any html element. Well that is just fine. The directive will ignore the `$scope.next()` function invocation when any of the `list` methods are called individually. \r\n\r\n### Options\r\n\r\n1. `ng-pass-event` -- event that will trigger the functions. Defaults to `click`\r\n\r\n2. `ng-pass-err` -- default error handler that will be invoked if any of the function throws err;\r\n\r\n3. `ng-pass` -- the main directive attribute. This needs to be passed a name of an array(that should exist in the current scope) and should contain the list of function names(that are defined in the current scope) OR a list of array itself like the following:\r\n\r\n`ng-pass=\"['validate','sanitize']\"` \r\n\r\nand each of them should exist in the current `$scope`\r\n\r\n### [Demo](http://jsfiddle.net/pn405j7q/11/)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
